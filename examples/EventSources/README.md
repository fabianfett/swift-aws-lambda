# EventSources

This package/executable can be used to test the different Event types. This especially usefull during development of new Event types. We use the sam `template.yaml` to deploy the external resources needed for testing. Please be aware, if you deploy the given `template.yaml` costs may occur (especially when using the LoadBalancer).
